The various QWC2 deployment methods are as follows, along with their pros, cons, and when to consider them:

1. Standalone Viewer
How:
-Extract pre-built QWC2 files(like the ones obtained through OSGEO4w) to your web server's document root.
-Minimal configuration (mainly editing config.json).
Pros:
-Simplest setup.
-Good for basic map viewing needs.
Cons:
-Lacks advanced features (editing, printing, user management, etc.).
-Any customization requires directly editing QWC2 source code.


2. QWC2 with qwc-services
How:
-Leverages additional Python-based services to extend functionality.
-Can be more manual installation (setting up each service) or streamlined with Docker.
Pros:
-Full range of QWC2 features.
-Highly customizable.
-Docker simplifies management.
Cons:
-More complex setup than standalone.
-Requires some familiarity with Docker or managing multiple web services.


3. Cloud-Hosted Options
How:
-Utilize cloud providers that offer pre-configured QWC2 instances or platforms for GIS web applications. (GeoServer)
Pros:
-Can be the fastest way to get QWC2 online.
-Managed infrastructure by the provider.
Cons:
-Potentially less control over customization, depending on the type of platforms that provide QWC services.
-Might incur ongoing costs but some are open source(GeoServer).


Choosing the Right Method
-For Simple map viewing: Standalone is sufficient.
-Need editing, user management, advanced features: qwc-services is the way to go.
-Want the easiest deployment with full features: Consider cloud-hosted options if your budget allows.
-Docker expertise: Makes qwc-services setup much more manageable.
